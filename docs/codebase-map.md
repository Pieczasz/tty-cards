# Codebase map

A diagram-first overview of the whole system: what exists, how the parts connect,
what is deliberately absent, and what could come next. It is a **map**, not a new
owner of facts. Every section links to the document that owns the detail
([`docs/README.md`](README.md) "Which document owns which fact"). When this file
and the code disagree, the code wins and this file is the one to fix.

*Snapshot: commit `3ab702e` (2026-09-23, branch `fix/review-2026-09`). Regenerate

## 1. System context (C4 level 1)

```mermaid
C4Context
    title tty.cards - system context

    Person(player, "Player", "Any SSH client. Identity = SSH key fingerprint")
    Person(visitor, "Website visitor", "Browser")
    Person(operator, "Operator", "SSH tunnel to the host")

    System(ttycards, "tty.cards", "SSH server that renders a card-game TUI. One process holds every table")
    System_Ext(pages, "GitHub Pages + Cloudflare", "Serves the static Astro site on www.tty.cards")

    Rel(player, ttycards, "ssh tty.cards", "SSH :22")
    Rel(visitor, pages, "Reads marketing site and blog", "HTTPS")
    Rel(visitor, ttycards, "Live stats panel calls /api/v1/*", "HTTP :80")
    Rel(operator, ttycards, "Grafana via ssh -L 3000", "loopback only")
```

There is **no web game client**, no game HTTP API and no WebSocket. The only HTTP
surface is a read-only stats feed. See [`architecture.md` §1](architecture.md#1-what-this-is).

## 2. Containers (C4 level 2)

```mermaid
C4Container
    title tty.cards - containers (compose.yaml)

    Person(player, "Player")
    Person(visitor, "Visitor")

    Container_Boundary(host, "One VPS, docker compose") {
        Container(nginx, "nginx 1.28", "stream + http", "Publishes 22 and 80 only, IPv4 and IPv6. limit_conn by /64, PROXY protocol to backend")
        Container(backend, "backend", "Go 1.27, cmd/server", "Wish SSH :6969 + Bubble Tea TUI + lobby/engine in RAM + stats API :6970")
        Container(migrate, "migrate", "golang-migrate", "Applies internal/db/migrations before backend starts")
        ContainerDb(pg, "Postgres 18", "SQL", "users, public_keys, games, rankings, matches, match_participants")
        Container(alloy, "Alloy", "OTLP receiver", "Receives pushed logs/metrics/traces, scrapes host")
        Container(sockproxy, "docker-socket-proxy", "haproxy", "GET-only containers and networks, internal network shared with Alloy alone")
        ContainerDb(loki, "Loki", "logs", "14 days")
        ContainerDb(tempo, "Tempo", "traces", "48 hours")
        ContainerDb(prom, "Prometheus", "metrics", "30 days")
        Container(grafana, "Grafana", "dashboards", "127.0.0.1:3000 only")
    }

    Rel(player, nginx, "SSH", ":22")
    Rel(visitor, nginx, "GET /api/", ":80")
    Rel(nginx, backend, "SSH + PROXY header, edge network only", ":6969")
    Rel(nginx, backend, "HTTP, X-Forwarded-For from $remote_addr", ":6970")
    Rel(alloy, sockproxy, "container discovery and logs", ":2375")
    Rel(migrate, pg, "DDL")
    Rel(backend, pg, "GORM / pgx")
    Rel(backend, alloy, "OTLP push", "gRPC :4317")
    Rel(alloy, loki, "logs")
    Rel(alloy, tempo, "traces")
    Rel(alloy, prom, "remote write")
    Rel(grafana, loki, "query")
    Rel(grafana, tempo, "query")
    Rel(grafana, prom, "query")
```

Why `:6969`/`:6970` are never published: [`decisions.md` #19](decisions.md#19-the-backend-speaks-proxy-protocol-and-6969-is-never-published).
nginx and the backend share the `edge` network (IPv6 on, fixed subnets), and the
backend believes a PROXY header or `X-Forwarded-For` only from it:
[#43](decisions.md#43-the-edge-network-runs-ipv6),
[#47](decisions.md#47-proxy-and-x-forwarded-for-are-believed-only-from-the-proxys-networks).
Limits at each layer: [`architecture.md` §2](architecture.md#2-topology).

## 3. Components inside the backend (C4 level 3)

Generated from `go list` imports (non-test), so it is what the compiler sees, not
what the docs hope. Game packages are grouped.

```

What the arrows prove:

- **`internal/game` depends only on `broadcaster` and `deck`**, and the rules
  packages add only `game/shed`. No db, no tui, no lobby. That is lint-enforced:
  `depguard` rule `game-is-pure` in `.golangci.yml` is an allow-list (the standard
  library, `deck`, `broadcaster`, `game/**`, `uuid`), so a new import is a decision
  ([#54](decisions.md#54-the-game-packages-import-from-an-allow-list)). `gametest` is
  exempt: it is test support.
- **Only `cmd/server` imports `internal/repository`.** Everything else sees the
  `db` interfaces (`depguard` rule `repository-only-from-root`).
- **`catalog` sits above both rules and views**, which is why `game` can never
  import it: it would be a cycle.
- **The TUI never reaches a `MatchRepository`.** Persistence after a game is the
  lobby's job. `router.GlobalContext` carries `*lobby.Manager`, `db.Profiles` and
  `db.Leaderboard`, nothing else that writes
  ([#50](decisions.md#50-consumers-ask-for-the-smallest-repository-interface)).
- **`internal/db` imports nothing of ours.** `repository.Connect` takes a DSN and
  pool settings, so the contract no longer reaches into `config`.

## 7. Design patterns and decisions, at a glance

| Pattern | Where | Why it is here |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy | `game.Rules`, five implementations | a sixth game touches the engine in no way |
| Optional interface (capability probe) | `TurnTimeoutHandler`, `TurnDurationHandler`, `PlayerLeaveHandler`, `StandingScorer`, `router.Closer` | opt-in behaviour without a fat interface. No timeout handler means no clock |
| Single registration point | `catalog.All`, each `Entry` embedding a `game.Module` | rules + view declared together. `catalog_test.go` catches missing fields and duplicate slugs, and `game.NewRegistry` panics on a half-declared or duplicate module |
| Facade | `game.BoundEngine` | the safe path is the default; `Frame`'s callback is the one way to whole-table state, and there is no `Engine()` escape hatch ([#5](decisions.md#5-boundengine-is-a-façade-not-a-capability)) |
| Embedded base type | `gameview.Session` | every view gets `Init`, binding, update loop, clock tick, cursor, action error, forfeit prompt, idle exemption and `Close` for free; `gameview.RenderHandOver` and `ChoicePicker` are the shared hand-over screen and suit/colour picker |
| Observer, latest-wins | `broadcaster.Broadcaster[T]`, reached only through `Engine.Subscribe`/`Unsubscribe`/`Dropped`/`SubscriberCount` | a slow SSH client can never stall the engine ([#3](decisions.md#3-latest-wins-broadcaster-and-subscribe-returns-an-error)), and no view can publish on or close a table's feed ([#51](decisions.md#51-the-engine-hands-out-subscriptions-not-its-broadcaster)) |
| Event as cue, not payload | `game.Event{Type, PlayerID, Reason}` | a dropped event costs nothing, the next `Frame` re-reads the truth |
| Snapshot / DTO | `StateSnapshot`, `BrowseEntry` | built under one lock, rendered lock-free. Hand sizes only |
| Fencing token | the engine's `clock.seq`, `SessionTracker` generations | stale timers and displaced sessions become no-ops |
| Repository, interface at the consumer | `internal/db` declares, `internal/repository` implements | swap point for Postgres; enforced by `depguard`. Each consumer asks for the smallest of `db.Authenticator`, `db.Profiles`, `db.Leaderboard` ([#50](decisions.md#50-consumers-ask-for-the-smallest-repository-interface)) |
| Shared test suite | `gametest.RunShed`, `gametest.SoakTimeoutIsAlwaysLegal` | crazy eights and uno run one set of shedding-game tests instead of two copies |
| Functional options | `lobby.Option`, `game.EngineOption` | |
| One label per game | the catalog slug as the `game_type` metric label, lobby and views alike | a dashboard never splits one game in two ([#49](decisions.md#49-the-game_type-metric-label-is-the-catalog-slug)) |
| Middleware chain | `wish.WithMiddleware` (runs last-first), `withCORS`/`withRateLimit` | |
| Elm architecture | every `tui/views/**` model | Bubble Tea |
| TTL cache + singleflight + generation | `repository.BestPlayers` (5 min; concurrent misses share one query; erasure bumps the generation) | a cold board is read by every lobby screen and the site at once, and an erased name must not be re-cached |
| TTL cache + dirty flag | public lobby list (2 s, atomic dirty flag, each entry re-checked on read) | the atomic flag exists to avoid inverting lock order |
| Single mutex per engine | `Engine.mu` | clock + state are always read together ([#1](decisions.md#1-one-mutex-per-engine)) |

Lock order, which every concurrency argument rests on: **tracker `t.mu` -> manager
`m.mu` -> lobby `l.mu` -> engine `e.mu`**. `State` has no lock. In Postgres, the
per-seat advisory lock comes before any row lock. See
[`architecture.md` §4.6](architecture.md#46-lock-order) and
[#45](decisions.md#45-the-session-tracker-lock-comes-before-the-managers).

The one decision most of the rest follows from: **one process holds the table.**
No Redis, no broker, no shared cache. Postgres keeps only what must outlive the
process.

## 8. What is there, what is not, what could be next

### 8.1 Deliberately absent (do not build without revisiting the decision)

| Absent | Reason | Record |
|---|---|---|
| Game loop / tick rate | the engine advances on an action or a timer only | [`onboarding.md` §5](onboarding.md#5-premises-that-do-not-hold) |
| Horizontal scaling, Redis, pub/sub | one process holds the table | [`architecture.md` §1](architecture.md#1-what-this-is) |
| Outbox table for match writes | two bounded drain windows instead; residual loss is stated and alertable | [#29](decisions.md#29-there-is-no-outbox-table-for-match-finalization) |
| Matchmaking queue | tables are browsed by Elo distance or joined by code | [`architecture.md` §3.4](architecture.md#34-lobby---internallobby) |
| Web or HTTP game client | the SSH terminal is the product | [`architecture.md` §1](architecture.md#1-what-this-is) |
| Passwords, email, account recovery | identity is a key fingerprint | [#16](decisions.md#16-identity-is-an-ssh-key-fingerprint) |
| Writes or auth on the stats API | narrowness is what makes it safe unauthenticated | [`architecture.md` §9](architecture.md#9-stats-api---internalhttpapi) |
| `/metrics`, pprof | the app pushes OTLP; nothing pulls it | [`architecture.md` §10](architecture.md#10-observability-and-retention) |

### 8.2 Known open items (not by design)

- **TLS on the apex is not configured.** The `:443` block in
  `internal/config/nginx.conf` is commented out. Until it lands, the `https` site's
  live-stats panel cannot call `http://tty.cards/api` and shows "server
  unreachable". Recorded as open in [#18](decisions.md#18-tls-is-not-terminated-here-yet-and-the-apex-cannot-sit-behind-cloudflare).
- **No tagged releases.** The changelog has only `[Unreleased]`, and there are no
  git tags.
- **Tracing stops at the session and the database.** `game`, `lobby` and `tui` are
  untraced, so a trace cannot show what happened between login and a match write.
- **No render-time metric.** Nothing times a `View()`; the benchmarks are the only
  signal.
- **No retention for inactive accounts.** Rows live until the player erases them
  ([`data-inventory.md` §1](data-inventory.md#1-stored-indefinitely---the-database)).
- **A new SSH key is a new account.** There is no way to attach a second key to an
  existing account, so changing laptops resets every rating.
- **`web/README.md` is the Astro starter template.** The real brief is `web/CLAUDE.md`.
- **The catalog lockstep hazard is accepted, not solved.** Copying an entry and
  changing only `Rules` compiles ([#6](decisions.md#6-catalogall-is-the-single-registration-point-and-the-lockstep-hazard-is-accepted)).

### 8.3 Not built, and no decision either way

No hit in non-test Go code for any of these: spectators, chat, bots, friends,
invites (beyond sharing a lobby code), tournaments, replays.

### 8.4 Candidate next steps

These are suggestions ranked by value over cost, not commitments. Each names the
seam that already exists for it.

1. **Terminate TLS on the apex** with certbot and uncomment the `:443` block. It
   unblocks the live-stats panel and needs no Go change.
2. **Link a second key to an account.** An authenticated session could add a
   `public_keys` row for a new fingerprint. The schema already allows many keys per
   user. Mind the anti-farm model: linking must not let one person merge alts.
3. **Tag a first release** and cut the changelog under it.
4. **Spectator seats.** The pieces exist. `StateSnapshot` is already the redaction
   boundary, and the broadcaster has `+8` subscriber headroom. What is missing is a
   read-only binding that never exposes a hand, plus a lobby route to reach it.
5. **Bots to fill a table.** Every game already ships a legal, safe move in
   `TimeoutAction`, which is soak-tested to pass `ValidateAction`. A bot seat could
   start by submitting exactly that. It must stay out of ranked play.
6. **Spans for lobby start and finalize.** Two spans would make a lost match
   visible in Tempo, not only as the `MatchFinalize(outcome="dropped")` metric.
7. **Retention for dormant accounts**, if the privacy policy needs one.
8. **Horizontal scale only when one VPS is not enough.** The seams are
   `broadcaster.Broadcaster[T]` and `Manager.lobbies`/`playerLobby`; the hard part is
   moving the lock-order guarantees across a network ([`onboarding.md` §5](onboarding.md#5-premises-that-do-not-hold)).

## 9. Keeping this current

Two code graphs index this repository. Both are local and gitignored.

| Tool | Refresh | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| GitNexus (`.gitnexus/`) | `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` | `impact`, `context`, `query`, `detect-changes` - required by `CLAUDE.md` before edits |
| code-review-graph (`.code-review-graph/`) | `code-review-graph update` (full: `build`) | communities, flows, hub and bridge nodes, `architecture`, MCP tools via `.mcp.json` |

Regenerate the package diagram in §3 from the compiler:

```bash
go list -f '{{.ImportPath}}: {{join .Imports " "}}' ./cmd/... ./internal/... \
  | sed 's#github.com/Pieczasz/terminal-card/##g'
```

Caveats when reading graph output for Go:

- **`code-review-graph dead-code` over-reports.** It lists the optional-interface
  methods (`TimeoutAction`, `OnPlayerLeave`, `StandingScore`, …) as dead because
  they are reached through a type assertion. `make deadcode` is authoritative.
- **Same-named symbols merge.** Its top hub, `Equal`, is `Player.Equal` fused with
  testify's `assert.Equal`. The meaningful bridges it reports are
  `FinalizeRankedMatch`, `updateRankings` and `Lobby.ToggleReady`.
- **GitNexus truncates flows.** Its analyze log says so. An absent flow is not
  an absent code path.
